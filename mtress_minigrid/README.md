# Model to simulate a heat pump, using MTRESS as template

This model simulates a heat pump to supply heat and domestic hot water for a residential building. Electricity is to be supplied by photovoltaic panels. In a later step, photovoltaic-thermal collectors (PVT) are to be added to the simulation.

This model uses MTRESS, a model template for residential energy supply systems, which uses oemof (Open Energy Model Framework) as a model generator to calculate optimal energy supply.
